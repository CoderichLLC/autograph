TODO:
  * Need a way to define idValue (for User.id)
  * Need a way to define idKey (for User.roles array of String)
  * Connection types need API args
  * Easy select('a b c d') syntax
  * Tests overhaul
    - Need to make sure that Scalar @field() is working
  * Break up Schema monolith (schema.parse() usage)
  * Pipeline user-defined id function needs to "ignoreNull" (how to ensure it does?)

Release 0.14
  * Remove deprecations

Known Issues:
  * MongoClient - not all queries go through $aggregateQuery and so you lose things like $project the result
  * You only need to $addFields for mongo regex when it's not already a String (eg. Boolean)
  * Referential integrity (onDelete) defined in embedded documents is not implemented
  * .flags({ debug: true }) - You will never see debug info when the result is cached and no driver called
    - query.flags.debug should not be at driver level
  * Transactions still act up once in a while when running the tests; also sometimes see a JSON circular reference

Improvement Considerations:
  * Resolver.graphql()
    - This requires executableSchema...
  * Ability to trigger validation/finalize?
  * Schema.validate()? Do you need/want schema definitions for Directives and Enums?
  * Can you derive transaction support by virtue of function definition existing?
  * create&updateMany is woefully slow due to individualized CRUD
  * Ability to override models' terminal commands (eg. one(), many())?
  * There are times you may NOT want resolver to CRUD an attribute (eg. NetworkPlace.parent should be set via meta because of side-effects)
  * Upsert???
  * EventEmitter
    - Debounce a function (debounce) to prevent excessive/redundant calls?
    - Memoize a function to prevent excessive/redundant calls?
  * Why do you send `${model}` in query instead of the actual model object?
    - I "think" this is because you clone query and it's better/faster to clone a string
  * You need proper events on embedded documents so that "construct": "createdBy" would work!
  * config.dataSources to determine if supports
    - Joins
    - Transactions
    - Batches
    - Referential Integrity (no need to ensureId)
    - Composite index keys (probably need to move these tests elsewhere)
  * onDelete defer - could probably be done dynamically instead
  * DataLoader - rewrite for batch queries
  * EnsureId - inline query?
  * Allow @field(key: "some.path") in order to hoist
    - Also, allow this at the GraphQL API query layer?
    - This has been discussed and https://github.com/graphql-kit/graphql-lodash exists (but its not recommended)
  * Support for GUID (node interface)
    - autograph.legacyMode (move to config)

BREAKING CHANGELOG:
  * PageInfo and cursor no longer required schema (only defined when cursorPaginating...)
  * Revamped how transactions work
  * Revamped how initial setup works (config.js)
    - makeExecutableSchema
  * Revamped Pipeline { schema, context, resolver, query, model, field, value, path, startValue }
    - No more pipeline on database result! (check default, transform/normalize, deserialize)
    - Pipeline "toId" is completely removed
    - Removed Pipelines [transform, deserialize, destruct, validate]
      - transform -> normalize
      - validate -> finalize
  * Revamped Emitter { schema, context, resolver, query { args, id, model, crud, key, doc, input, sort, result } }
    - "Basic" functions are hoisted to the top for execution; RETURNING a value will bypass thunk()
    - "Next" functions are run next, next() must ALWAYS be called; passing a value to next() will bypass thunk()
    - Event arguments refactored (no more merged! use query.input)
    - Getter to "changeset" on update
  * Emitter.on('setup') is passed the "parsedSchema" object
  * No more gqlScope, dalScope, fieldScope (use crud + scope)
  * resolver.resolve() now takes 1 argument (info) and requires you to use .args() etc if need be
  * $Magic methods now have signature doc.$.<method> and are more powerful and chainable
  * Resolver now sets itself at context.autograph
  * createNamedQuery is replaced by Resolver.$loader
    - cb function now has signature (args, context)
    - cache is on by default and persists indefinitely (must be managed)
  * MongoClient now seperate NPM module @coderich/autograph-mongodb

---------

* select('author.*') // populate/hydrate (left join)
* where('author.name') // join
